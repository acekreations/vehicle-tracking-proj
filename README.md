# vehicle-tracking-proj

Design Overview:
For this project I wanted to find a unique approach that would be efficient, modern and unique. I was inspired by command/operations centers as I imagine this is a tool that would be useful in that kind of environment. I leaned into a darker color palette imaging these command centers tend to be dimly lit. I wanted to use color to emphasize the status of vehicles/drivers and quickly convey what vehicles or drivers were active or potentially available to be assigned. This was also my method for adding a pop of color to an otherwise monochromatic palette. The layout is intended to minimize switching views and maximize the map real estate. When exploring the layout I went through many variations that separated the vehicles and drives into different views or put  an emphasis on vehicles, it finally dawned on me that vehicles and drivers are equally important and in particular when looking at the map its just as likely that a user would be looking for a driver on the map as they would be looking for a vehicle. I settled on the two panels split by the map so that a user can look at both vehicles and drivers at the same time and if they want to assign either they can just click on the card and a modal appears with the ability to change the assigned vehicle or driver. If the user wants to really maximize the map, both the panels are collapsible and will give a nearly full screen map when collapsed.
